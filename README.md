# About me!✌️
Hey there, I am Ankit Mishra, I am from India and I am a high school student currently studying in 10th<br> Standard, I have a keen interest in computers and programs, and also mathematics, I have been learning <br> Javascript and its framework lately, I am very interested on how computers perform mathematical <br> operations from code!

# What can I do? 🤔

I know how to code using technologies such as HTML, CSS and Javascript, while I'm currently <br> still learning Backend and Javascript frameworks, I plan to expand my stack until  <br> I can make MERN projects!
